# Surviving-UWaterloo
This is a shooting game I made where the player is an University of Waterloo student and he is struggling to get through his first year math courses. The easier courses have fewer life points and the harder courses are more difficult to pass. There are awards associated with harder courses, such as double eraser powerup, pen powerup (3x damage) or an extra life. 
You can click to pause and click again to continue the game. This is version 1.0. In the future, I am planning to add different courses from different majors, intruduce stages (school terms) and boss planes. In addition, the high scores from people can be submitted directly to a sub branch of my website and the top scores could be displayed there.
I edited and drew most of these images with the help of GIMP and lunapic.com. Please contact me at jesselingxunmeng@gmail.com if you have any feedback to give!
